        Dhanurasana, also known as the Bow Pose, is a yoga asana that resembles an archer's bow when performed. In Sanskrit, "Dhanu" means "bow," and "asana" means "pose" or "posture." Dhanurasana is considered an intermediate-level yoga pose and offers a range of physical and mental benefits.

            <br><br> 
            <i>Etymology and Symbolism:  </i> 
            <br><br> 
                    The Sanskrit name “Dhanurasana” is derived from two words: “Dhanu” (meaning “bow”) and “asana” (meaning “pose” or “posture”).   
                    When you practice Dhanurasana, your body takes the shape of a taut bow, just like an archer's bow.   
                    Symbolically, the well-strung bow represents determination, consistency, and strength—qualities that you'll cultivate within yourself during this pose.   
                    <br><br><br>  
            <i>Prerequisites and Timing:  </i> 
            <br><br> 
                    To maximize benefits, perform Dhanurasana 4-5 hours after your main meal.   
                    Ideally, practice it in the morning. If not, include it in your evening routine.   
                    Warm up with preparatory poses like Shalabhasana (Locust Posture) and Bhujangasana (Cobra Stretch).   
                    <br><br><br>  
            <i>How to Do Dhanurasana (Bow Pose):  </i> 
            <br><br> 
                    Lie flat on your stomach with your feet hip-width apart and arms alongside your body.   
                    Bend your knees and reach back to hold your ankles with your hands.   
                    Inhale deeply, lift your chest off the ground, and simultaneously pull your legs up and backward.   
                    Keep your gaze forward, maintaining a gentle smile.   
                    Your body now resembles a taut bow.   
                    Focus on your breath and hold the pose, but don’t overstretch.   
                    After 15-20 seconds, exhale and gently lower your legs and chest back to the ground.   
                    Release your ankles and relax.   
                    <br><br><br>  
            <i>Tips for Beginners:  </i> 
            <br><br> 
                    Pay attention to your breath—inhale as you go into the pose and exhale as you come out.   
                    Bend backward as far as your body comfortably allows.   
                    If holding the ankles is uncomfortable, use a strap.   
                    Remember the balance of sthira (steadiness) and sukha (ease).   
                    <br><br><br>
