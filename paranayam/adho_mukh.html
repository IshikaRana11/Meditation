          >Adho Mukha Svanasana, often referred to as Downward Facing Dog or
          simply Down Dog, is a foundational yoga pose that combines stretching
          and strengthening aspects. In Sanskrit, "Adho" means "downward,"
          "Mukha" means "face," "Svana" means "dog," and "Asana" means "pose" or
          "posture." This pose resembles the stretch of a dog stretching
          itself.</b

        Let's delve into the details: 
         
        Starting Position: 

                Begin by standing upright with an erect spine, feet together, and big toes slightly touching each other.  
                Your hands should be by your sides.  
                Distribute the weight of your body evenly between both heels and toes.  
                Take a moment to relax and breathe deeply.  
                <br> 
        Transition to the Pose:  

                Kneel on the floor, maintaining hip-width distance between your knees.  
                Incline forward and place your hands on the floor directly under your shoulders.  
                Keep your thighs and arms perpendicular to the floor.  
                Align your hands with your knees, ensuring your shoulders are directly above your wrists.  
                Press your hands into the ground.  
                Curl your toes, exhale, and gently lift your hips, moving your knees away from the floor.  
                Your body should now resemble an inverted “V.”  
                <br> 
        Final Position:  

                Straighten both your elbows and knees.  
                Allow your heels to touch the floor, and your ears to touch the inner arms.  
                Gaze at your navel.  
                You’ll feel an intense stretch in the back muscles of your legs.  
                Maintain this position for as long as you feel comfortable.  
                Breathe deeply.  
                <br> 
        Cautions and Alignment:  

                Ensure correct alignment to avoid misalignment.  
                Avoid straining while lifting the hips and torso.  
                Distribute weight evenly between your hands and feet.  
                If you have carpal tunnel syndrome, weak or injured shoulders or heels, or any inflammation in your eyes or ears, avoid this pose.  
                Individuals with high blood pressure can practice it gently.  
                Those with chronic joint inflammation should recover fully before attempting this asana.  
                <br>
