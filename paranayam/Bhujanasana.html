        Bhujangasana, also known as Cobra Pose, is a foundational yoga pose that involves arching the back while lying prone on the ground. In Sanskrit, "Bhujanga" means "cobra," and "asana" means "pose" or "posture." Bhujangasana is a beginner-friendly backbend that offers a variety of physical and mental benefits

        <h2> 
            Meaning and Origin:  

                    The Sanskrit name “Bhujangasana” is derived from two words: “Bhujanga” (meaning “serpent”) and “asana” (meaning “posture”).  
                    When you practice Bhujangasana, your body resembles a cobra with its hood raised, hence the name.  
                    This pose is a gentle backbend that strengthens the spine and offers various health benefits.  
                    <br> 
            How to Perform Bhujangasana:  

                    Lie flat on your stomach with your legs straight, feet together, and heels slightly touching.  
                    Place your palms beside your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body and pointing outward.  
                    Rest your forehead on the floor and relax your entire body.  
                    Inhale deeply and gradually lift your forehead, neck, and shoulders.  
                    Engage your back muscles to raise your chest, and then use the strength of your arms to lift your trunk.  
                    Look upward while breathing normally.  
                    In the final position, ensure your navel doesn’t rise more than 3 cm, and your pubic bones touch the floor.  
                    Hold this pose for 20-25 seconds.  
                    To return to the starting position, exhale and slowly lower your navel, chest, shoulders, neck, and forehead.  
                    Practice Bhujangasana 3-5 times, ideally before or after a forward bending pose like Paschimottanasana (seated forward bend).

            Precautions: 

                    Arch your spine without applying excessive force.  
                    Gradually build strength and flexibility; avoid rushing.  
                    Use your back muscles to support your upper body weight.  
                    Keep your feet grounded; prevent unintentional lifting.  
                    If you have hyperthyroidism, hernia, peptic ulcer, or intestinal tuberculosis, practice under guidance.
