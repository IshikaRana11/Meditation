          Meditation is a practice that has been around for thousands of years
          and is present in various forms across different cultures and
          spiritual traditions. It involves training the mind to achieve a state
          of mental clarity, emotional calmness, and heightened awareness. While
          meditation has historically been associated with religious or
          spiritual practices, it has gained popularity in secular contexts as
